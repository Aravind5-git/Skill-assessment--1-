## AIM
Write an assembly language program in 8051 to generate a 250 ms delay using Timer 1 in Mode 1 and blink an LED connected to Port 0.5 continuously.

## APPARATUS REQUIRED
- Personal Computer  
- Keil ÂµVision Software  

## PROGRAM


```
ORG 0000H
MAIN: MOV TMOD, #10H   
      CLR P0.5         
AGAIN: MOV TH1, #9EH   
        MOV TL1, #58H   
        SETB TR1        
WAIT:   JNB TF1, WAIT  
        CLR TR1         
        CLR TF1         
        CPL P0.5        
        SJMP AGAIN      
END
```
